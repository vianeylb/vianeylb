I am a statistician primarily interested in working in the areas of statistical ecology, time series modeling, Bayesian statistics and, more recently, spatial modeling of environmental data. Currently, I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistical Sciences and School of the Environment at the University of Toronto. 
 
Collaborative projects bring me loads of joy. So, while I am formally trained in mathematics and statistics, I'm likely to be working closely with marine biologists (esp. those who work with sharks) often and on many projects. 

See my [google scholar page]https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=VGNhAyYAAAAJ) for a full list of my publications. A copy of my dissertation is accessible [here](/files/Dissertation.pdf).
