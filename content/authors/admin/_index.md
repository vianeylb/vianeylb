I am a statistician primarily interested in working on Bayesian statistics and time series models. In particularly, how these methods can be applied in the field of statistical ecology to understand drivers of animal movement. 

Collaborative projects bring me loads of joy. So, while I am formally trained in mathematics and statistics, I'm likely to be working closely with marine biologists (esp. those who work with sharks) often and on many projects.
